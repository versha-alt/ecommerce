# Reports

## Assumptions

-   Admin-only scope. Storefront implementation is excluded; only admin
    configuration and explicit storefront contracts/impact are
    documented.
-   Single Kenyan retailer, multi-brand, omnichannel, English-first and
    Swahili-ready.
-   Currency is KES; prices are VAT-inclusive by default. VAT supports
    16%, zero-rated and exempt classes.
-   Scale baseline: 5--10K active SKUs at launch, 300--500 orders/day
    with 3--5× peaks; architecture must remain viable toward 100K+
    products and 1M+ customers.
-   API prefix is `/api/v1`; IDs are UUIDs; timestamps are UTC ISO-8601
    and rendered in `Africa/Nairobi`.
-   Backend is NestJS + TypeScript; PostgreSQL is system of record;
    Redis provides cache/queues; OpenSearch provides catalog/admin
    search and facets.
-   Admin frontend is React + TypeScript + Vite, TanStack React Query,
    React Hook Form + Zod, and MUI as the recommended component library.
-   Every mutation writes an immutable audit event containing actor,
    action, entity, before/after summary, IP, user agent and correlation
    ID.

Reports cover sales, VAT/eTIMS, inventory, customer, marketing
attribution and per-store performance. Heavy reports query reporting
projections/warehouse replicas rather than blocking OLTP.

``` ts
interface ReportRun { id:string; reportCode:string; parameters:unknown; format:'csv'|'xlsx'|'pdf'; status:string; requestedBy:string; expiresAt?:string }
```

REST: `GET /api/v1/reports/catalog`; `POST /reports/runs`;
`GET /reports/runs/:id`; CRUD `/reports/schedules`.

Filters are report-specific; exports honor branch and field-level
permissions. Scheduled reports store recipients by role/user rather than
exposing arbitrary sensitive data destinations.

Permissions: `reports.sales.read`, `reports.tax.read`,
`reports.inventory.read`, `reports.customer.read`,
`reports.marketing.read`, `reports.export`, `reports.schedule`.

### Storefront impact

None.

## Open questions

1.  Which ERP/accounting platform, if any, is authoritative for stock,
    cost and invoices?
2.  Which KRA eTIMS integration mode/provider will be contracted?
3.  Are branch managers allowed to view cross-branch customer/order
    data?
4.  Which payment aggregator and BNPL providers are confirmed for
    launch?

## Standard list/filter contract

List endpoints support `page`, `pageSize`, `sort`, `q` and
module-specific filters. Unknown filters return `400`. Exporting the
current filter creates an async job. Saved views are user-owned unless
explicitly shared by an administrator.

## Standard mutation response

``` json
{"data":{"id":"uuid","version":2},"meta":{"correlationId":"req_..."}}
```

Validation failures use HTTP 422; authorization uses 403; optimistic
version conflict uses 409; missing resource uses 404. External provider
failures map to stable internal error codes and retain provider
correlation IDs without leaking secrets.

## Observability

Every request carries a correlation ID. Metrics include latency/error
rate, queue lag and provider failure counts. Domain events use an outbox
transaction so database state and event publication cannot silently
diverge.
